# Privacy policy

W.r.t. the Chrome Privacy Policy requirement (16/04/2016), here is the Privacy Policy for [ProKeys](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/prokeys/ekfnbpgmmeahnnlpjibofkobpdkifapn):

1. The word "user data" refers to the data stored by the user in Snippets or in Settings.
2. All user data is stored in either local chrome storage area or sync chrome storage area, both of which are implemented by the Chrome browser and provided for use to developers; the user is allowed to switch between the two.
3. The app does not transmit the user data to any external server anywhere, except in the case of sync storage when the data is synced by Chrome on user's signed-in machines, and is associated with the user's Google account with which they're signed in. This storage area is handled by Chrome hence and outside of the developer's reach.
4. The user data is not shared with any third party.
5. The user data is only used to provide the functionality as explained on the [description page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/prokeys/ekfnbpgmmeahnnlpjibofkobpdkifapn).
6. The developers (Gaurang Tandon and Varun Singh) CANNOT access user data, from single or multiple users, either in identifiable or  anonymised form, in any manner.
7. The browsing activity, history, bookmarks, etc., or any other thing that has not been described in the descriptions page, is NOT accessed and NOT stored.
8. The user data is stored only as long as the user uses ProKeys. Once they uninstall ProKeys, the user data is lost too (apart from the sync storage data, managed by Chrome)

By using ProKeys, you, as a user, agree to the above privacy policy.
