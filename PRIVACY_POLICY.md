W.r.t. to the Chrome Privacy Policy requirement (16/04/2016), here is the Privacy Policy for ProKeys (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/prokeys/ekfnbpgmmeahnnlpjibofkobpdkifapn):

1. The word "user data" refers to the data stored by the user in Snippets or in Settings.

3. The app does not transmit the user data to any external server anywhere, except in the case of sync storage when the data is synced by Chrome on user's signed-in machines, and is associated with the user's Google account with which he/she is signed in. This storage area is handled by Chrome hence and outside of the developer's reach.
4. The user data is not shared with any third parties.
