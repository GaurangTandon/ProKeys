ProKeys needs the following permissions for corresponding reasons:

## Chrome

1. "Read and change all your data on the websites you visit" - this makes sure that Prokeys is able to perform its functions - expand snippets, auto-inserts, mathomania, etc.
2. "Display notifications" - only when the app is installed or updated, to notify you of latest goodies :)
3. "Read data that you copy and paste" - to accomplish the clipboard paste feature inside of snippets.

While the permissions above may sound dangerous, we're using them properly and respect your privacy before anything else. We also favor transparency so you can check out the latest code [on GitHub](https://github.com/GaurangTandon/ProKeys).  
We can also assure that your data is not sent to any external servers as has been stated in our [privacy policy](https://github.com/GaurangTandon/ProKeys/blob/master/PRIVACY_POLICY.md).
