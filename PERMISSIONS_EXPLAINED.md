# Permission explanation

ProKeys needs the following permissions for corresponding reasons:

## Chrome and Opera

1. "Read and change all your data on the websites you visit / Access your data on all websites" - this makes sure that Prokeys is able to perform its functions: snippet expansion, auto-inserts, mathomania, etc.
2. "Display notifications" - only when the app is installed or updated, to notify you of latest improvements.
3. "Read data that you copy and paste" - to provide the clipboard paste feature inside of snippets.

While the permissions above may sound alarming, we use them responsibly and respect your privacy before anything else. We also favour transparency, so you can check out the latest code [on GitHub](https://github.com/GaurangTandon/ProKeys).

Your data is NOT sent to any external servers, as has been stated in our [privacy policy](https://github.com/GaurangTandon/ProKeys/blob/master/PRIVACY_POLICY.md).
