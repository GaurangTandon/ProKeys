# Testing
Currently, we use [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/) for testing.

To run the test, just type `npm run test`, and you are done!

If for some reason puppetter is not working, check
[this](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md).
For linux, most probably
[this](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md#alternative-setup-setuid-sandbox)
will work.
