					<h2>Info</h2>					
					<dl>
						<dt>What are snippets (snips)?</dt>
						<dd><p>Snippets are pairs of an abbreviation and a long text. Typing the abbreviation, pressing the hotkey (default: Shift+Space), replaces it with the long text.</p>
							<p><b>Example:</b> Snippet with snippet name - "brb". The snippet name is the abbreviation. It is <b>case-sensitive</b>, so "brb", "BRB", and "bRb" are all different.
							Typing "brb" and pressing the hotkey, would replace it with the snippet body, which here is "be right back".
							Snippets can be created in the popup box.</p>
							<a href="#tryit">Try snippets in editor</a> - you can view the snippets in the popup box</dd>
						
						<dt>Can a deleted snippet be restored?</dt>
						<dd>No, unfortunately, snippets once deleted cannot be restored. Therefore, it is recommended you take a backup regularly.</dd>
						
						<dt>What are Placeholders?</dt>
						<dd><p>Placeholders are fields in the snippet body which are populated with dynamic values provided by you on using the snippet. A placeholder has the format `%text%` such that the text can only contain alphabets, digits and the underscore symbol.</p>
							<p><b>Example:</b> snippet "wishBDay", which you can use to wish your friends Happy Birthday! Since the name of the friend keeps changing, so you can add a placeholder to the snippet body, as "%name%"(without quotes). It would be auto-highlighted whenever you use the snippet and you can type your friend's name into it.</p>
							<a href="#tryit">Try the "letter" sample snippet in editor</a>
							<p><b>Usage</b> of a placeholder:
							<ol>
								<li>Insert placeholders into the snippet body while creating or editing a snippet. Then, use this snippet.</li>
								<li>The first placeholder would be auto-highlighted. Type whatever you want to type there.</li>
								<li>Press `[Tab]` key to move to the next placeholder.</li>
								<li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 till all placeholders are done filling.</li>
							</ol>
							</p>
						</dd>
						
						<dt>What is Mathomania?</dt>
						<dd><p>Often, mathematical calculations require you to leave your current work and use the calculator. But, using Mathomania, you can do calculations within the text editor itself.</p>
							<p><b>Supported operations</b> are: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation (like: 2^3; of integer constants only), and percentage (using % symbol). You can group expressions using parentheses too.</p>
							<p><b>Usage:</b>
							<ol>
								<li>Press square bracket key twice, the other `]]` pair of braces would auto-complete.</li>
								<li>Type the math expression to be evalated inside the braces.</li>
								<li>Press `=` (equals) key and the result of evaluation would replace the `[[...=]]`!</li>
							</ol>
							</p>
							<a href="#tryit">Try math expressions in the editor</a> (like "[[5^3=]]")
						</dd>
						
						<dt>What are Date/Time macros?</dt>
						<dd><p>Date-Time macros can be used to insert current date and time related data.</p>
							<strong>Usage</strong>
							<p>They are to be placed inside a snippet body while <em><strong>creating</strong> the snippet</em>.
							<ol>
								<li>Place "[[%d()]]" (without quotes) inside the snippet body.</li>
								<li>Place one or more of the symbols inside the parentheses, from the symbol list.</li>
								<li>When you use the snippet, this entire string of `[[%d(...)]]` would be replaced by the current value of the symbols it contains.</li>

						<dt>What is Date/Time arithmetic?</dt>
						<dd><p>Date and Time arithmetic lets you move forward or backward in time in the Date/Time macros. It is of <b>two types:</b></p>
							<p><b>1. Relative: </b>All the macro symbols inside a parentheses perform calculations relative to the same date, and have a single shared copy of the date. So, calculations on one symbol change that same shared copy, and could affect result of another symbol. Like, on forwarding a date by 10 days (using <span class="code">[[%d(D+10)]]</span>), if the date is caused to move into another month, then <i>that changed month</i> would be used as the current month for any calculation on any month symbol further inside the parentheses. Similar rules apply for changing minutes (causing the hour to change), etc.<br>
								To indicate relative calculation, add a <span class="code">!</span> at the start, like this: <span class="code">[[%d(! D+5 M-5 ....)]]</span></p>
							<p><b>2. Independent (Default): </b>All the macro symbols while performing calculations are independent of one another. So, if forwarding a date by 10 days (using <span class="code">[[D+10]]</span>), causes the date to move into another month, still, <i>that changed month</i><b><i> would not be used as the current month</i></b> for any calculation on any symbol further inside the parentheses. All the symbols would have their <i>own separate copy</i> of the date.</p>
							<p><b>Usage: </b>After a date/time macro symbol, you have to place a "+" or "-" sign (indicating whether to move forward or backward respectively), followed by a number, which would indicate the amount by which to move forward or backward. No white space or any other character should be used between the symbol, sign, and number. So, <span class="code">[[%d(Do+5 M-10)]]</span> is valid, while <span class="code">[[%d(Do - 5 M- 10)]]</span> is invalid.
							<p><B>Evaluation</b> of these symbols is from left to right, and the symbol that appears first (at the top) in the symbols list, is evaluated first.</p></p>
							<p><b>Example: </b>Consider this date/time macro: <span class="code">[[%d(YYYY:MM:D)]]</span>. If you want to move 10 days forward and 5 months backward,
							 you could write: <span class="code">[[%d(YYYY:MM-5:D+10)]]</span> This was independent calculation. If you it to be relative, use <span class="code">[[%d(!YYYY:MM-5:D+10)]]</span> (with that <span class="code">!</span>)</p>
							 <a href="#tryit">Try date and time arithmetic in editor</a> (use dateArithmetic sample snippet)
							 <p><b>Limitation</b>: The "date" and "time" symbols do not support date and time arithmetic (I might fix this in future).</p>
							 </dd>
						<dt>What are Variables?</dt>
						<dd><p>Variables are used to insert dynamic values at any time while typing. They are inbuilt and cannot be created by you. Of course, I would love a recommendation from you for a new variable! (email: prokeys.feedback@gmail.com)</p>
							<p><b>Usage:</b>
							<ol>
								<li>Type `[[`, the other pair of braces `]]` would auto-complete.</li>
								<li>Type the variable name inside them, and press `=`.</li>
								<li>This entire `[[...=]]` would be replaced by the dynamic values of these variables.</li></ol></p>
							<p>The following Variables (case-insensitive) are supported:
							<table>
								<tr>
									<td>Variable name</td>
									<td>Value it holds</td>
									<td>Sample output</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>date</td>
									<td>current, complete date</td>
									<td>March 05, 2015</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>time</td>
									<td>current, complete time</td>
									<td>01:29:55</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>version</td>
									<td>current browser version</td>
									<td>Chrome 43.0.2357.130</td>
								</tr>
							</table>
							</p>
							<a href="#tryit">Try these variables in editor</a>
						</dd>
						<dt>How are Variables different from Snippets?</dt>
						<dd>Variables are more useful when you need to retrieve system-related dynamic values. Like the version of the browser, which would need to be manually entered into a snippet. A Variable would get it automatically.</dd>
					</dl>
					<hr>
					<h2>Troubleshoot</h2>
					<dl>
						<dt>Snippet replacement is not working</dt>
						<dd><ul>
							<li>Make sure your caret(cursor) is placed just after the snippet name. Example: If your snippet name is "abcd", place your caret after "d"</li>
							<li>Snippet names are case-sensitive. "ABCD" and "abcd" are not the same.</li>
							<li>Refresh the webpage you are working on.</li>							
							<li>If nothing works, then take a backup of your data and reinstall ProKeys. Restore your data back and try again.</li>
							<li>If it <em>still</em> does not work, contact me at prokeys.feedback@gmail.com</li>
						</ul></dd>
						<dt>I get an error reading: "Invalid Snip Name! Please prefix it with a underscore and try again." while creating/editing snips.</dt>
						<dd>Some words cannot be allowed because they interfere with the internal working of ProKeys. But prefixing them with an underscore will allow you to use them, though you'd need to type the underscore at the start while using it on a webpage. Example, if word 'abcd' gives this error, then use '_abcd' as the snippet name.</dd>
